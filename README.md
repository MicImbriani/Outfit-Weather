# Outfit-Weather
 
In this personal project, I will build a deep learning software which, given a picture of a person dressed in a full outfit, determines whether the outfit is appropriate for the current weather in the user's city.

The model will be implemented using PyTorch, and trained on the very well known Fashion-MNIST dataset (which also comes withing PyTorch library itself). To get the weather data, a third party API will be employed.
